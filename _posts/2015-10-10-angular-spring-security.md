title: Angular Spring Security Example
---
There is a great article describing how to add authentication to your Angular App. In that example they are serving the resources from a separate server using spring boot.
The server code is built using groovy. For those (like myself) not familiar with groovy I decided to reimplement the server in Java.
You can see this example running at http://141.138.139.81:8080 and the source code here [Angular Client](https://github.com/metherton/angular-spring-security-client) and [Java Server](https://github.com/metherton/angular-spring-security-server)
