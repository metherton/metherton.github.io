 **[Here](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/)** is a great article describing how to add authentication to your Angular App.
In this example they are serving the resources from a separate server using spring boot.
The server code is programmed in Groovy. For those (like myself) not familiar with Groovy I decided to reimplement the server in Java.
You can see this example running at **[Angular Authentication example](http://141.138.139.81:8080)** and the source code here **[Angular Client](https://github.com/metherton/angular-spring-security-client)** and **[Java Server](https://github.com/metherton/angular-spring-security-server)**.
Login credentials are user name: **user** and password **password**
