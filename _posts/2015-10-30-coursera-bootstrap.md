I am currently studying the **[Full Stack Web Development Specialization course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack)** offered by the Coursera online education organization.
The second part of the course covers the Bootstrap framework, which we are using to build an example web site. Each week we are adding new features.
The result can be seen **[here](http://www.martinetherton.com/conFusion/index.html)** and the source code for the site **[here](https://github.com/metherton/webframeworkcourse)**
